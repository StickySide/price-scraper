# Price Scraper

Modular, extensible python tool for scraping and tracking product prices and stock availability.

This project was built as a learning experience in web scraping, data handling, and general python development.

It is intended for **educational and personal use only**


## Authors

- [StickySide](https://github.com/StickySide/)


## Features

- **Automated**: Scraping with retry logic and back-off to avoid rate-limiting.
- **Data Collection**: Saves scrapes to csv
- **Discord Notifications**: Rich discord notification system that alerts based on price thresholds, and historical stock and price changes.
- **Modular** Intended for python coders to plug their custom scraping code.

## Roadmap

- **Graph Trends**: Plotting trends graphically
- **Web access**: Simple web server for self-hosted access to data and scraping configurations.


## Installation

```git clone https://github.com/stickyside/price-tracker.git```

```pip install requirements.txt```

```python -m price_scraper```

- If using the selenium based scraping options, you'll need firefox and geckodriver installed.


### Requirements
- Python 3, and these modules
    - discord
    - beautifulsoup4
    - pandas
    - requests
    - selenium


## Configuration

- **Scheduling**: Intended to be used with cron or another scheduler to run hourly.

- **General Configuration**: ```config.py``` contains general scraping configuration. The default values will work for most cases. You **will need to set your discord webhook** for notifications.

- **Scraping Targets**: ```targets.py``` contains a list of targets the program will target. I've left some of my settings in as an example, but stripped the URL for legal reasons. Each field is commented for set up. Add as many targets as you like.

- **Custom Code**: The ```Requester```, ```Parser```, and ```Scrape``` classes need some custom coding to scrape your desired website. You'll need some experience with scraping. I left my code in as an example.

- **Notifications**: In Discord, navigate to a channel you own, click the gear icon to "Edit channel" and select "Integrations" then "Webhooks". Make a new webhook, name it, add an icon if you like and then "Copy webhook URL" and paste it into config.py WEBHOOK_URL. Optionally you can use environment variables as I have in the config file.
## Acknowledgements
- The awesome Python community

- GPU scalpers for the motivation to learn to code and create this script so I might snag one at a fair price...
